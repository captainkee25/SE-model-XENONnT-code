# SE-model-XENONnT-code
This repository contains the code used for my Bachelor thesis involving the modelling of the delayed single and few electron emissions in XENONnT.

peak_selection.ipynb includes some based plots created by STRAX, the processing framework for XENONnT. These plots were used to select the peaks for study (see All plots/peak_selection.png)
